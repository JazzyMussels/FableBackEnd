Perhaps, in this insatiable need for perpetuation, we should better understand human suffering, if we knew that it was eternal.

It is true healing for the spirit. It is a supreme victory of grace.",

But neither you nor I have suffered as they, and even we have born witness in silence to lesser ills under less dire threat. Yet, in the face of evil, to sit silent is an even greater evil. Complacency is ever the enabler of darkest deeds;",
    "Does he who is always waiting suffer more than he who’s never waited for anyone?",
    "People never remember happiness with the care that they lavish on preserving every detail of their suffering.",
    "Your suffering needs to be respected. Don't try to ignore the hurt, because it is real. Just let the hurt soften you instead of hardening you. Let the hurt open you instead of closing you. Let the hurt send you looking for those who will accept you instead of hiding from those who reject you.",

    "We all fight over what the label 'feminism' means, but for me it's about empowerment. It's not about being more powerful than men - it's about having equal rights with protection, support, justice. It's about very basic things. It's not a badge like a fashion item.",
    "I think some big actors and musicians feel like they have to speak to their audience and that word feminism is confusing to their audience. But I don’t get it. That’s like someone being like, ‘I don’t really believe in cars, but I drive one every day and I love that it gets me places and makes life so much easier and faster and I don’t know what I would do without it.",
    "A woman must not accept; she must challenge. She must not be awed by that which has been built up around her; she must reverence that woman in her which struggles for expression.",
    "As an artist, I never wanted to be fettered by gender nor recognised or defined as a female poet, musician or singer. They don’t do that with men - nobody says Picasso, the male artist. Curators call me up and say, We want your work to be in a show about women artists, and I’m like, why? For Christ’s sake, do we have to attach a gender onto everything?"
